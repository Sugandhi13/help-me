- The create profile form has form validation features and displays errors if a field is left blank or filled incorrectly.

![create_profile_form_error](static/images/readme_images/create_profile_form_error.png)

- If the form is valid, the user is redirected to their user profile page, where they see a success message stating that their profile has been created. 

![create_profile_success](static/images/readme_images/create_profile_success.png)

    - In the event that another user attempts to access the profile, a card will appear, providing an explanation of the situation and offering links to either the community board or the user profile.

    ![profile_not_created_other_user](/static/images/readme_images/profile_not_created_other_user.png)

    - If an unauthenticated user attempts to access a profile, a card will be displayed, offering a similar explanation. However, instead of providing an option to visit the profile, it will feature a button prompting the user to sign up.

    ![profile_not_created_other_user](/static/images/readme_images/profile_not_created_other_user_not_auth.png)

#### User profile

- The main difference between the user profile and the posts board is that there is no possibility of filtering posts; all displayed posts belong to the user, and a card with the user's profile information is visible. 
- When the authenticated user is on their profile, they can create posts and also edit their profile by clicking the 'Edit Profile' button. 

![user_profile](static/images/readme_images/user_profile_general.png)

- If the user does not have any posts, a message will be displayed stating that the user has no posts
- When the authenticated user is on another user's profile, they are not able to edit that user's profile, as the 'Edit Profile' button is not displayed. Additionally, they cannot create posts. An explanation is provided with links to the board page or their own profile. 

![user_profile_no_posts](static/images/readme_images/user_profile_no_posts.png)

- When a non-authenticated user is on a user's profile, they cannot see the user's profile information and cannot create a post either.

![user_profile_no_authentication](static/images/readme_images/user_profile_unauthenticated.png)

- Edit Profile: When the user wants to edit their profile, a modal is opened, and all the fields are pre-filled with the existing profile information.

![edit_profile_modal](static/images/readme_images/edit_profile_modal.png)

- If the edit profile form is successfully submitted, a success message is displayed, stating that the profile has been updated.

![edit_profile_success](static/images/readme_images/edit_profile_success.png)

- In the edit profile modal, there is also a delete profile button. This button will open another modal that will ask for confirmation from the user about deleting their profile.

![delete_profile_modal](static/images/readme_images/delete_profile_modal.png)

- If the user decides to delete their profile, they will be logged out, and their posts, comments, user profile information, and login credentials will be permanently deleted from the application.

![delete_profile_success](static/images/readme_images/delete_profile_success.png)

- The posts and post buttons have the same functionality as described in the [board section](#board).

### Future Features

- Asynchronous behaviour
    - When a post is liked or commented on, the page is automatically reloaded. A future feature is planned to avoid reloading the page when these actions are taken by the user.

- Post information datamodel
    - The idea of world areas and holiday types is good for filtering and differentiating posts, but additional details such as country and author could enhance this feature
    - The country should be implemented as another dropdown list with the countries selected based on the chosen world area.

- Further relevant feedback
    - Remove the sign-in and sign-out messages.
    - Implement notifications to inform users when their posts or comments have been approved.
    - Implement notifications for when another user has commented or reacted to a post.
    - Implement notifications for when a comment is added to a post a user has commented on.

1. Go to [Track Tales Repository](https://github.com/juanovt10/tracktales-blog)
2. In the top right, click the "Fork" button.
3. There will now be a copy of the repository in your own Github account.

### Running the project locally

1. Go to [Track Tales Repository](https://github.com/juanovt10/tracktales-blog)
2. Click on the "Code" button.
3. Choose one of the following three options and click copy.
    - HTTPS
    - SSH
    - Github CLI
4. Open termina in your preferable IDE (cloud or local).
5. Type `git clone` and paste the URL that was copied in step 3. 
6. Press enter and the local close will be created.

### Deploying with Heroku

The following steps were taken from the Django "I think before I blog" walkthrough project provided by [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/global/).

1. Login or create an account in [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login). 
2. Go to your dashboard on the top right and click the `New` dropdown button and select `Create New App`.
3. Enter a name of the project (must be unique).
4. Select the region your are working in. 

#### External database set up

I used [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) as my database. 

1. Login or create an account. 
2. In dashboard on the right top corner click `Create New Instance`
3. You will be forward to a `Select a plan and name`:
    - `Name` should be the name of the project
    - `Plan` should be the type of subscription you have with ElephantSQL, in my case I used the `Tiny Turtle (Free)` plan.
    - `Tags` can be left in blank

    Then click on `Select Region`.

4. Here selecte your `Data center`. This is hosted with AWS. In my case due to my location I used `EU-West-1 (Ireland)`. Please note that you should select an AWS Availability Zone (AZ) closest where your main users will be located to reduce downtime.

    Then click `Review`.
5. Here you will check the name, cloud provider and region where the application will be hosted. If, everything is correct, click `Create instance`.
6. Go to dashboard and your instance will be there. Click in the name and under `Details` copy the `URL`, this will be values that will be needed for the [Heroku variables setup](#heroku-settings) and the [env.py](#envpy-file-set-up) file.

#### External storage set up

I used [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/ip/gr-sea-gg-brand-home-base?utm_source=google&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=goog_selfserve_brand_wk22_replicate_core_branded_keyword&utm_term=1329&campaignid=17601148700&adgroupid=141182782954&keyword=cloudinary&device=c&matchtype=e&adposition=&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAm4WsBhCiARIsAEJIEzUYoKHM06ldJtPMxUmtjFK3HxOkfQI3_8G9vOXPuRsPWuCVCSFEPzsaAjiJEALw_wcB) as cloud storage for this project. 

1. Create and account or login. 
2. Go to `Dashboard` and copy the `API Environment variable`.
3. This URL will be required when setting up the [env.py](#envpy-file-set-up) and the [Heroku variables](#heroku-settings). 

#### env.py file set up

1. In the root directory of your project create a new file called `env.py`.
2. Add this `env.py` file to your `.gitignore` file so the confidential information in the file is not push to Github.
3. In the `env.py` file import the `os` module and add the [database URL](#external-database-set-up).

```
os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]="<copiedURL>"
```

4. Then, using the same process create a `SECRET_KEY`. This can be anything, I used [RandomKeygen](https://randomkeygen.com/) to create a complicated key. 

```
os.environ["SECRET_KEY"]="<copiedGeneratedKEY>"
```

5. Then, using the same process, in the `env.py` file import the `os` module and add the [storageURL](#external-storage-set-up).

```
os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"]="<copiedCloudinaryURL>"
```

6. Save the file.

#### Heroku settings 

After the application is created in Heroku. Got to your dashboard and you will see the application name, click on it and then follow the following: 

1. Go to the settings tab and go to `ConfigVars` and click on `Reveal Config Vars` and set the following variables: 
    - Key: `PORT`, Value: `8000`
    - Key: `DATABASE_URL`, Value: [databaseURL](#external-database-set-up)
    - Key: `CLOUDINARY_URL`, Value [storageURL](#external-storage-set-up)
    - Key: `SECRET_KEY`, Value: [randomKey](#envpy-file-set-up)

2. After setting up the variables, go to `Buildpacks` and select `Python`.

#### Heroku deployment 

1. Go to `Deploy` tab and under `Deployment method` connect to the Github repository.
2. Then there can be two options: manual or automatic deployment. 
    - Manual deployment means that it will be necessary to go to Heroku and deploy the application each time that changes are made. 
    - Automatic deployment will re-deploy the application each time new code is pushed to Github. 
3. After selecting the deployment method, under `Manual Deployment` click `Deploy branch`.

### Design

The site type was a mixed between a social media and blog web application. The following sites were used for instpiration: 

- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/)
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com)
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) 

Additionally, the [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/) framework was heavily used for the front-end development.

### Code

In Django, the typical workflow for creating a view involves writing the view code first and subsequently creating the template to render the view. However, I took a slightly different approach by starting with the template to visualize the application before refining the code. During this process, I faced an issue that wasn't addressed in the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/global/) Django walkthrough projects, particularly regarding the customization of form styling.

Initially, I applied Bootstrap classes to style the forms, but I encountered challenges to display the form fields with the desired styling. Thanks to the insights gained from [CodingEntrepreneurs Tutorial](/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quJzUzCs6Q0&t=623s), I was able to achieve the desired styling by implementing html attributes in the [forms.py](/postBoard/forms.py) file.

Given the project's data models, a crucial requirement was to generate a new user profile data instance upon a user's signup, followed by redirecting them to a "create profile" page for further profile completion

To address the first challenge, I devised two methods within [models.py](/postBoard/models.py) adorned with a receiver decorator. The initial method creates the user profile, while the subsequent method utilizes the newly generated username to populate the user profile created in the first method. This solution was inspired by insights gleaned from a relevant [Stack Overflow discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65876529/how-to-create-instance-of-model-during-user-registration-process-django). 

For the second issue, my inclination was to avoid altering predetermined properties in django-allauth. However, consulting another insightful [Stack Overflow discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20138049/redirect-user-to-another-url-with-django-allauth-log-in-signal?newreg=b829fa7359404ec7b3765563ae9f145b) guided me towards a solution. I introduced a new redirect method in [views.py](/postBoard/views.py) to seamlessly direct the user to the "create profile" page immediately after completing the signup process.

Another challenging feature I grappled with was prepopulating fields when users desired to edit a post or their profile. Initially, I attempted to utilize the get methods to extract data from the backend and populate the fields, but this approach proved ineffective. Seeking assistance, I came across a helpful [Stack Overflow discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12439180/prefill-form-with-jquery) that guided me to leverage JavaScript, specifically jQuery. This solution enabled me to retrieve the current existing data and seamlessly prefill the forms with this information.

During troubleshooting, I encountered challenges in understanding how to effectively debug activities occurring in the backend. To address this, I incorporated the [Django messages feature](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/contrib/messages/#using-messages-in-views-and-templates). This implementation allowed me to display errors occurring in the templates, providing valuable insights during the debugging process.

In the final stages, while working on the presentation of dynamic content like post likes, post comments, and dates, I encountered limitations with certain syntax within the template. To overcome this issue, I discovered [Django custom template tags](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/howto/custom-template-tags/). This feature proved invaluable as it enabled me to present likes, showcase comments alongside their respective posts, and exhibit dates for both posts and comments in a more user-friendly manner
